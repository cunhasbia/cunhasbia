## Hi, Welcome! :)

I'm a software development student who loves the vastness of technology and who is always looking to be better than yesterday!

‚Ä¢ Currently working at **IBM** :blue_heart:
<br/>‚Ä¢ Focused on **Javascript** stack;
<br/>‚Ä¢ Enthusiast about the best development technologies;
<br/>‚Ä¢ I love to talk about: Programming, Science, Astronomy, Blockchain, Music;
<br/>‚Ä¢ Curious fact: I am also Tourismologist graduated from PUCRS and I worked hard in the area for 5 years.

**I believe that if programming is the language of the future, we women should be part of this construction** üë©‚Äçüíª
