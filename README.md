## Hi, Welcome!

I'm a software development student who loves the vastness of technology and who is always looking to be better than yesterday!

• Currently focused on **Javascript** stack for front and back-end;
<br/>• Enthusiast about the best web & mobile development technologies;
<br/>• I love to talk about: Programming, Science, Astronomy, Music;
<br/>• Curious fact: I am also Tourismologist graduated from PUCRS and I worked hard in the area for 5 years.

**I believe that if programming is the language of the future, we women should be part of this construction** 👩‍💻
